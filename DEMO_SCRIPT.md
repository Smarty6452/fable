# 🎙️ Fable - Hackathon Demo Script (2 Minutes)

## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Problem & The Introduction
**(Visual: Slide or Landing Page)**
"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. This is **Fable**."

"Here's the problem: Speech therapy is critical, but it's **expensive** ($150/hr), **inaccessible** (12-month waitlists), and for kids, practicing at home is **boring**. They lose motivation, and parents feel helpless."

"Fable changes that. It's a **voice-first adventure game** that turns boring repetition into magical gameplay, powered by **Smallest.ai**'s hyper-realistic voice models."

## 0:30 - 1:40 | The Demo (Voice-First Flow)

**(Action: Click Microphone on Homepage)**
"Let's play. Notice I don't need to type. The entire app is navigable by voice for pre-literate kids."
*   **User**: (Clicks Mic) *"My name is Leo."*
*   **Fable**: *"Nice to meet you, Leo!"*

**(Action: Buddy Selection)**
"We pick a companion to guide us."
*   **User**: *"I choose Wolfie!"*
*   **Fable**: *"You picked Wolfie! Great choice!"* (Wolfie's voice)

**(Action: Gameplay)**
"Now the core loop. Fable uses **Smallest Pulse** for real-time phoneme detection."
*   **Wolfie**: *"Say... SUN!"*
*   **User**: *"Sun!"* (Clear pronunciation)
*   **Wolfie**: *"Amazing job!"* (Confetti explodes)

**(Action: Error Handling)**
"If I get it wrong..."
*   **Wolfie**: *"Say... MOON!"*
*   **User**: *"Moooo"* (Mumured)
*   **Wolfie**: *"Almost! I heard 'Moo'. Try 'Moon' with an N sound."*

**(Action: Parent Dashboard & Call)**
"Finally, we close the loop. Parents get real-time insights—and even a phone call from the AI agent."
*   *(Click 'Call Me' on Dashboard)*
*   *(Show phone ringing/simulated call)*: "Hi, this is Fable! Leo practiced 5 words with 90% accuracy today!"

## 1:40 - 2:00 | Future Scope & Impact

"This isn't just a game. We're building a bridge for organizations like **KidsAbility** to extend clinical care into the home."

"By making this tool free and accessible, we can partner with non-profits like **Food4Kids** to support low-income families who can't afford private therapy."

"Fable: Giving every child a voice. Thank you."
